Why did I decide to learn data science? Everyone has a different story to tell on why they decided to learn data science. Mine starts with when I first graduated from University at Buffalo.

Like most people, I was pursuing the path of my undergraduate degree. I graduated from University at Buffalo with an Undergraduate Degree in Mathematics with a focus concentration in Actuarial Science. I started applying for jobs relating to that field, while studying to pass the actuarial exams.

The below link is a list of some of the many actuarial exams in case you want to know what they are.

As I was spending my time at home self-studying the materials I bought online, I was questioning myself if this was the correct path for me. 

*** Do I want to spend the rest of my time self-studying for exams? **

*** Am I fit for this career path? **

*** Why haven't I gotten any good results?**

*** Is this what I want to do with the rest of my life?**


I asked myself all these questions. A year later, I had only passed two of the many actuarial exams and I did not get any job offers. I couldn't handle spending any more time doing nothing but trying to pass more exams just to get a better chance at getting hired. I needed a change in my life.

When one wants a change in their life, they

*** Go on a trip**

*** Start a new job**

*** Change a career path**

I didn't exactly want to do any of the above, so I decided to go back to school to further my education to see if I still want to pursue Actuarial Science. 

My next steps were to 

1. Study for the GRE
2. Take the GRE
3. Apply for graduate school 
4. Get accepted 
5. Take classes 

While doing the above steps, I need to take into consideration whether I still see myself pursuing Actuarial Science. I got accepted to City College for their Master of Science Degree program for Mathematics. I started reconsidering my options during one of the classes I took at City College. This course was called Advanced Mathematical Statistics and it was taught by Professor Shirshendu Chatterjee. I was always looking forward to this course because I had an interest in statistics. 

The first semester with this professor flew by and the second semester came before I knew it. The second part of this course was called Advanced Topics in Statistics. It was also taught by Professor Shirshendu Chatterjee. Like most courses with two parts, the second part is more difficult. It required some coding experience as a prerequsite for this course because we needed it for the exams and the final project at the end of the course. I had prior experience using SQL and Excel, but I had no knowledge in using R or MATLAB. Luckily, the professor offered a crash class for MATLAB and provided us with reading materials on how to use MATLAB to do calculations.

It was during this period that I figure I not only enjoyed statistics, I also liked to code and figure out the different issues I get while I was coding. Although it was difficult to learn the class materials and coding at the same time, I felt that it was rewarding. 

The final project was worth talking about because it is related to data science.

* We were given an Air Quality dataset to work with from the site below.

* Then we had to clean up the dataset in order to use the data to answer the different questions we had.

* We applied the stepwise variable selection method to the Air Quality dataset to eliminate excess variables that hinder the linear regression model.

* After that we generated AIC, adjusted R<sup>2</sup> and CP Plot to select suitable subset of four variables.

At the end of the course, I found out that the entire project could have been completed on R with one line of code. I was completely mind blown by this fact. There are a lot of different programming languages out there that can simplify the work we need to do to solve problems we have. I really enjoyed the two semesters we spent learning from professor Shirshendu Chatterjee. 

When I heard he was teaching an independent study course along with professor Asohan Amarasingham, I quickly signed up for it. It was a course in machine learning which required prior Python knowledge. Since I knew that this course required prior Python knowledge, I spent my vacation between semesters to study Python. This class was a challenge because it was the professors' first time hosting this type of independent study course. We followed the book *DEEP LEARNING with Python* by Francois Chollet. The book taught the basics of machine learning, but I felt that the course didn't provide enough hands-on experience.  

It was after this class that I learned that I had enjoyed the coding, the statistics and problem-solving aspect of data science. I acknowledged my interest in data science after attending a Fordham Mathfest event about the daily work of people in fields of data analytics, science and computer science. At the event I met many people coming from different backgrounds. I met someone that studied arts, but ended up working in the field of data science. There were also two people who did a boot camp similar to this and ended up working in the field of data science.

Everyone came from different backgrounds, but they were all able to get positions in the data science field. Upon further consideration after the Fordham Mathfest I decided to pursue a position in the data science field. However, I needed to find a good program that provided good teaching and hands on experience. That is where I heard from a friend that he did a bootcamp with Flatiron School and I found out that it offers a data science program. All these events led me down this path to apply for the data science program at Flatiron school and learn data science.
