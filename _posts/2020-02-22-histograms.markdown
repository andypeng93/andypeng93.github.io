What is data visualization? Data visualization is a way to express information and data through charts, graphs and maps. In other words, it is a tool that allows us to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in our dataset. 

There are many different visualization techniques to present your data to clients. Examples of visualization techniques that we have seen before are line plots, bar charts, pie charts, histogram plots, and scatter plots.

1. **Line Plots** - This technique is used to plot the relationship between one variable to another variable. Below is a picture of the graph y = x, we can see that this graph plots the relationship between x and y. It shows that as x increases by 1 unit, y would also increase by 1 unit and if x decreases by 1 unit, y will also decrease by 1 unit.

2. **Bar Charts** - This technique is used for comparing quantities of different groups. Values of each group are represented by a vertical or horizontal bar. The picture below shows what a horizontal and vertical bar chart looks like. We can see that the biggest quantity among the different groups are represented by the longest or the tallest bar in the graph.

3. **Pie Charts** - This technique is used to compare each group's percentage to the whole data set. There are a lot of disagreements with whether this is a good technique for data visualization or not. The reason why this technique is not good is that it can be difficult to estimate areas and angles of the pie chart. Consider the picture below, would you be able to determine which has the bigger area the gray or the blue without the legend telling you the percentages? Our human eyes don't have the ability to detect the angles of the pie chart.

4. **Histogram** - This technique is similar to bar charts, but the only difference is that it represents the distribution of a continuous variable over a given interval or period of time. We group together data into intervals called "bins." The usage of this technique is to figure out the distribution, outliers and skewness. The histogram below broke the data into 6 bins or in this case 6 age groups. The height of the bars is represented by the frequency of data that fall into each age group category. We can see that most people ages 16-20 voted M&M as their favorite candy.

5. **Scatter Plot** - This technique is used for examining the correlation between two variables. Each marker represents an observation. But what is a marker? A marker is a symbol that we use to represent the observations on a scatter plot. They can be dots, squares, plus signs or whatever you want. Consider the scatter plot below, we can see that sales are on the y-axis and temperature is on the x-axis. Each dot marker represents an observation from our data. By graphing all our data, we can try to determine if there is any correlation between the temperature and the sales.

These are examples of data visualization that we have seen before. There are many other kinds of data visualization that we have not seen before such as heat maps, stacked bar graphs, matrix charts, etc. If you are interested in learning more about the other types of data visualizations, please click on the link below.

But what is the best visualization technique to present the data to people? In my opinion the best visualization technique would be histograms. What makes histogram my choice of data visualization? What are the usages of histogram? What are the strengths? What are the weaknesses? What makes histograms so special? 

**Histogram Usages**
Histograms are used to figure out the distributions, outliers and skewness of a data set by grouping together data into intervals. How can we determine the distributions, outliers, and skewness by just looking at the histogram?

The above picture shows examples of the different distributions of our data set through the usage of histograms. It also shows two examples of our data being skewed to the left and to the right. By graphing a histogram, we can easily determine what kind of distribution it is just by looking at the overall structure of the graph. Histograms not only show distributions and skewness of our data, but it also shows outliers of our data. As shown below, we can see that the data boxed in red is an outlier because it is so far off the rest of our dataset.

**Histogram Strengths**
The benefits of using histograms are that we can use it to figure out the distributions, outliers and skewness like mentioned above. Not only that, we can also use it to determine statistical information about our data such as the average, median, maximum and minimum of our data set. Unlike the other data visualization techniques, we can adjust the bins to display our data set. Some people may consider this a problem with histograms depending on how we use bins to display our data set. Too many bins can make analysis of our data set difficult, while too little bins can leave out important information. Even though using too many or too little bins can cause problems, we can still learn information from our mistakes. Overall, histograms are great to use to summarize large data sets graphically.

**Histogram Weaknesses**
Although histograms have many benefits, there are also weaknesses. A weakness of histograms would be choosing that this graph only works for two features of our data set. This would be a horrible choice of data visualization for data sets with multiple features. 

However, after considering the weaknesses of histograms I still feel that this data visualization technique is still the best. There are still a lot of information we can learn from even if we are considering two features of our data set. Do you agree? What do you guys feel is the best data visualization technique?
